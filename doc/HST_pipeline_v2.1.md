#
# The HST Migration Pipeline Architecture

Version 2.1

July 9, 2024

#
# Terms

- Program ID = the four or five-digit numeric HST proposal ID.
- PPPSSOOT = the format of the first nine characters in the root name of a file. I indicates instrument, PPP indicates program, SS for visit, OO for observation, T for transmission/association.
- IPPPSSOO = the first eight characters. On occasion, files have the same “IPPPSSOO” but the “T” character is different. Nevertheless, files with the same IPPPSSOO are always associated, regardless of the “T”.
- VISIT = the two character designation for the HST visit, the “SS” in IPPPSSOOT.
- TRL: File suffix that describes the processing history of all the files with the same IPPPSSOOT prefix.
- SPT/SHM/SHF: File suffix that identifies the target for each IPPPSSOOT prefix. These are often collectively referred to as “SPT” files, even if the suffixes differ.

#
# "Logically Complete"

- The “logically complete” set of data files is one in which every file to which another file might refer is also in the set.
  - The pipeline will produce incorrect results if an attempt is made to run it on sets of files that are not logically complete.
- Often, all the files with a single IPPPSSOO are logically complete.
- For files with associations (e.g., repeat and CR-split exposures), the logically complete set is defined by the union of:
  - the IPPPSSOO of the association file “\*\_asn.fits”
  - every other file with that IPPPSSOO.
  - every file with an IPPPSSOO referenced within the association file.
- You can recognize these cases because the “T” in IPPPSSOOT is a digit, usually 0. Under other circumstances, the “T” is never a digit.
- Because associated files never cross a visit boundary, it probably makes most sense to focus on archiving files by visit.
- A visit is limited to ~ 6 orbits of HST, so this approach has the advantage of also limiting the volumes of data that the pipeline has to deal with at any given time.

#
# File System Organization

- I suggest we organize all information about the processing pipeline by program ID and visit within a single directory tree.
- The directory path is always `<root>/hst_\nnnnn>/visit_<ss>/`, where nnnnn is the program ID (with leading zero if needed) and ss is the visit.
- The root directory is always defined by the content of an environment variable “`HST_PIPELINE`”.
- All processing logs are separated by visit and saved in within a subdirectory “`logs/`” inside each visit-level directory.
- Any other information that needs to be managed by the pipeline can be saved in files within this tree.
- We should not use this directory tree to store data files and their labels while in development.
- I suggest we use the same hierarchy, but have them in a root directory defined by environment variable “`HST_STAGING`”.
- The pipeline also needs to reference the location of all current HST bundles as defined by environment variable “`HST_BUNDLES`”.
- See the document PDS4-VERSIONING.txt on Dropbox for the details about the layout of the `HST_BUNDLES` tree.
- Note: It probably makes sense to move the target identification WEBCACHE out of GitHub and into this directory tree as `<HST_PIPELINE>/target-identifications/WEBCACHE`.
- Summary:
  - `HST_BUNDLES`: store final deliverable bundles.
  - `HST_STAGING`: store data files downloaded from MAST.
  - `HST_PIPELINE`: store data info for each proposal id, including pipeline logs, program info file, list of product names and trl checksum file.

#
# What is a Task?

- A task is a single stand-along program that executes some piece of the pipeline and then stops. It can be typed as a command at the terminal if desired.
- Every time a task runs, it creates a unique log file describing what it has done.
- Tasks are designed to be relatively independent of one another, so that multiple tasks can run in parallel, using multiple threads, without interfering with one another.
- Log files are given the name of the task, followed by “`-yyyy-mm-ddThh-mm-ss.log`” containing the local time at which the task started in the format year-month-day-hour-minute-second. They are saved in “`logs/`” subdirectories at various levels in the file system hierarchy.
- The pipeline is “queue-based”, meaning that it maintains a queue of available tasks.
- Just before completion, tasks typically generate one or more new tasks and add them to the task queue.

#
# The Task Queue

- The design and implementation of the Task Queue and the Queue Manager is in `HST/queue_manager` module. Task at the later pipeline stage and with higher priority will be executed first, this will make sure the pipeline prioritize finishing a bundle over starting a new process.
- Requirements include:
  - A task can add one or more new tasks to the queue, with a specified delay or level of priority, and then proceed asynchronously.
  - A task can add one or more new tasks to the queue, with a specified level of priority, and then wait for them to finish.
  - A task can ask the queue manager if a task that it sent to the queue manager is now complete.
- Priorities are 1 (Lowest) to 5 (Highest).
  - Priorities are assigned so that once we begin processing an HST bundle, we prioritize finishing it over starting a different bundle.
- Rob has agreed to research Queue Manager options for us. After Rob's research, we've agreed on implementing our own Queue Manager.
