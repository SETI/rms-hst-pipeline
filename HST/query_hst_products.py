# query_hst_products.py
#
# query_hst_products is the main function called in query_hst_products pipeline task
# script. It will do these actions:
#
# - Query MAST to get all available visits and files in this program.
# - Create directories <HST_PIPELINE>/hst_<nnnnn>/visit_<ss>/ if they don't exist.
# - Download all TRL files to <HST_STAGING>/hst_<nnnnn>/.
# - For each visit:
#   - Update or create products.txt in <HST_PIPELINE>/hst_<nnnnn>/visit_<ss>/.
#   - Update or create trl_checksums.txt in <HST_PIPELINE>/hst_<nnnnn>/visit_<ss>/.
# - Delete all TRL files.
# - Return the tuple of changed visits & all available visists.
